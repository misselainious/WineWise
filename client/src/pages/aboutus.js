                                    Hiram Simon began his career relatively late in the last century at The Wine Society, a unique English institution owned entirely by its customers – one of the few remaining Co-operative Societies in Britain, which is today still the pre-eminent mail-order and internet retailer. The man whose job he coveted just  retired recently.  Not, however, before obtaining a brilliant training in the basics i.e. Bordeaux, Burgundy and Champagne, with the occasional leavening of Sherry, Rhône and German Riesling, or, on exotic days, Chianti and Rioja. Despite the proto-socialist character of the place (famed leftist Edmund Penning-Rowsell was its long-serving Chairman), daily drinking consisted mostly of aged classed-growth Bordeaux and fine burgundy. After debunking to London for an especially unhappy year at an advertising agency, he came to California, specifically Berkeley (his home to this day), on Labor Day, 1982.

                                        Brian Greenwood burst onto the wine scene in Cambridge, Massachusetts at the now defunct Cave Atlantique, long before most of you were born. His memories of that halcyon year return more to exploring the glories of Loire Chenin and Cantonese food (or lobster and champagne) with his tasting group than to the training he received, which was cursory at best. Given no grounding in the classics, he made his way to California wines and fairly quickly to our fair state. He worked four years in retail before joining a California winery /brokerage as both a salesperson and member of the wine making team; the fact that he was uniquely unqualified for either seems to have gone unnoticed by his partners.
